<h1 id="title">Among us- all you need to know</h1>
<h2 class="infotitle-info">Basic Info</h2>
<p class="infotitle-info">Among us is a information game that requires strategy and logic. The basic idea is for The Crewmates<span id="COLORwhite">(the innocent)</span>figuring out the imposter<span id="COLORred">(the evil)</span>. For the imposter, you must kill every single crewmate, or at least most of them. Innersloth are a team of about 4-5 people, and they are they group of developers that created Among us, as well as Dig to China and Henry Stickmin. There are lots of easter eggs and secrets in the maps of among us related to different games; so keep your eyes peeled!</p>
<h2 class="ZESECRETANDEASTER">The secrets and easter eggs</h2>
<p class="ZESECRETANDEASTER">
  These are among us easter eggs and secrets and BARELY anyone notices them!<br>
  <br>
  Starting with:<br></p>
  <h3 class="ZESECRETANDEASTER">1. The origin of Polus</h3>
  <p class="ZESECRETANDEASTER">The biggest map in the game has the weird name "Polus". Aren't you wondering what's the reason behind it? Well, query no more because here is the answer:<br>
  A police officer in Innersloth's game Henry Stickmin won a competition. His name was Polus Petrovich and got the planet named after him. </p>
  <h3 class="ZESECRETANDEASTER">2. The peeking crewmate</h3>
  <p class="ZESECRETANDEASTER">In the Lab on the map Polus there is a bathroom. In one of the stalls, you see a glimpse of a white crewmate, or more well known as The Peeking Crewmate. One of the developers released a full picture of the crewmate. We might find out who it is in later updates!</p>
  <h3 class="ZESECRETANDEASTER">3. The Legend Of Zelda reference</h3>
  <p class="ZESECRETANDEASTER">On Mira HQ(click <a href="#titleTheMaps">here</a> to learn more about the maps, click <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sportskeeda.com%2Fesports%2Fwhy-the-skeld-best-map-among-us&psig=AOvVaw1z5uWDS-86Dg2drPJp_lzI&ust=1608544586791000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CAIQjRxqFwoTCLje_del3O0CFQAAAAAdAAAAABAN">here</a> to see a picture of The Skeld, click <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fgamewith.net%2Famong-us-wiki%2Farticle%2Fshow%2F22105&psig=AOvVaw2oGJwDLM1sNfXQO0XRtJsU&ust=1608544755482000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CAIQjRxqFwoTCMiirKum3O0CFQAAAAAdAAAAABAc">here</a> to see a picture of Mira HQ, click <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fgamewith.net%2Famong-us-wiki%2Farticle%2Fshow%2F22105&psig=AOvVaw3cg63vnaoWO737E0aDn2kS&ust=1608544869143000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CAIQjRxqFwoTCOiCn-Cm3O0CFQAAAAAdAAAAABAk">here</a> to see a picture of Polus), there is a room called green-house, and one of the rocks in the task(click here to learn more about tasks)water plants might look familiar to you if you have played Legend Of Zelda. Specifically, it is the Korok that you have as a companion in one of the missions.</p>
  <h3 class="ZESECRETANDEASTER">4. The Anti-gravity box</h3>
    <p class="ZESECRETANDEASTER">The anti-gravity box is a box that is floating in the air for a few seconds in the room storage on the map Skeld so that you czn hide behind it in case a imposter is chasing you. It's very useful!</p>
    <h3 class="ZESECRETANDEASTER">5. The QR code</h3>
   <p class="ZESECRETANDEASTER"> On Polus, there is a scan boarding pass task in the office, which has a QR code printed on it. Some people wondered if the code actually meant something. Sure enough, they were right, and they saw that it meant "yo holmes, smell ya later" which is actually a line said by Will Smith in the theme song of "The Fresh Prince Of Bel-Air".</p>
    <h3 class="ZESECRETANDEASTER">6. The Satellite dish</h3>
    <p class="ZESECRETANDEASTER">There is a satellite dish near cafeteria on Mira HQ which you can hide behind to catch imposters or get sneaky kills. VERY, VERY, VERY helpful.</p>
    <h3 class="ZESECRETANDEASTER">7. The Snowy Rock</h3>
    <p class="ZESECRETANDEASTER">On Polus, near the lava pit, there is a large rock. If you're imposter, you can hide behind it and bait a crewmate there. once there in place, kill them then move a way. You can't see the body! Unless someone is paying close attention to their report button...</p>
<h2 id="titleTheMaps">The Maps</h2>
<p id="pgTheMaps">
   There are 3 different maps on Among Us, two of which(Polus and Mira HQ) used to be paid deals and The Skeld was not. Innersloth is actually releasing a new map called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LaY8nQyM_0">The Airship</a>. This map includes a new skin, new kill effects and new features. The maps include different tasks, skins and rooms. Some have features that the other one doesn't. But one thing's for sure, they're all fun!
</p>
<h2 class="ZeRolesPlusAnatomy">The Roles and anatomy</h2>
<p class="ZeRolesPlusAnatomy">
  On Among Us' Twitter account, Innersloth said that imposters are actually parasitic shapeshifters, which make sense talking about those teeth and their skewers(click here to learn more about the kill affects). But what exactly are crewmates? Crewmates are based on the creation of the poralians. I mean, look at them! The similarities are undeniable. But the anatomy, well, Crewmates have a rubber suit, screen, one bone and an oxygen tank. In the new map, hands are added.
